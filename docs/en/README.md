## Quick start

A detailed description of each tab can be found via the links above.

- You need to create a separate instance for each dartboard.  
- One instance can only connect to a single board at a time.  
- As soon as the IP and port of the Boardmanager are entered, the instance can be started.  
- If the darts server is shut down, the instance stops automatically and continues operation seamlessly when the darts server starts again.
